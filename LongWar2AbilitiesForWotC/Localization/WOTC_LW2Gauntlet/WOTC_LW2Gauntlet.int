BriefSummary="This combination flamethrower-minirocket launcher was devised for our Technicals to handle a variety of combat situations."
TacticalText="<Bullet/> The XCOM gauntlet is an advanced device that carries both a minirocket launcher and a flamethrower.<br/><Bullet/> The Rocket Launcher carries one rocket initially and it has a three-tile radius for its area of effect.<br/><Bullet/> It may target anything in sight range.<br/><Bullet/> Damage from rockets falls off from the point of impact.<br/><Bullet/> The flamethrower is a short-range weapon that causes damage to multiple targets within a cone-shaped area of effect.<br/><Bullet/> The flamethrower has two charges and does not damage mechanical units without upgrades.<br/><Bullet/> Using either gauntlet ability requires one action and ends your turn.<br/><Bullet/> Rocket accuracy is affected by the soldier's aim, target distance, and whether the soldier has used any actions already this turn. Low accuracy-rockets will have higher scatter values, meaning they are more likely to miss the target tile by greater distances. The rocket's maximum possible scatter is noted in the popup, while a value appearing with the targeting cursor will show the expected (average) scatter for a shot on that location."
